                    Write down the jobs or positions you held with the job title of each, in addition to mentioning the name and address of the company or institution in which you worked with the time periods of these jobs.
                    
                    You should always be honest and honest in writing your resume. Do not write what you have not learned, done, or what you have no experience with, because the HR manager may ask you in detail about it or ask you for tasks related to this topic, and you lose your credibility, reliability, and the opportunity you want.

                    This section includes the academic degrees you have obtained, whether university or secondary, in addition to mentioning the years, the name of the university and its location with the name of the specialization as well.

In this section list the skills you possess that you have acquired from courses or from non-professional sources. What we mean is that the skills and experience you gain from previous work should be included in the work experience section and not in the skills section.

The skills section of the resume is essential, especially for fresh graduates and people with poor experience.

Skills can be divided in general into soft skills and hard skills, so what do they mean?</h2>

                        Soft skills
This term refers to the traits and personal behaviors of the author of the CV, such as:

Good communication skills.
Effective time management.
Adaptability.
Creative thinking.
Teamwork.
Soft skills are acquired mainly through contact with colleagues in the work environment, or participation in volunteer activities.

                        If you are fluent in more than one language, you can mention them in the languages section, specifying your level in each language.

Does it matter how many languages you master or not? Of course it matters, but the most important thing is the degree of your mastery of each language. Being fluent in two or three languages is much more important than speaking four or five languages as a beginner.</h2>

                        <h2>
                            Introduction or career goal
Although a CV is a document that includes your professional and academic information, some prefer to write a CV introduction that is an additional small paragraph in which they talk about their skills and experience and express their passion in their own style.
                        </h2>

                            Research
In some jobs such as pharmacy or medicine, it will be very helpful to mention your research activity on your CV even if the job title does not include scientific research. This means that you are up to date with the latest developments in science and want to be effective in this movement and not just someone who practices his profession according to what others have found. Therefore,
 in this case, you can add a section for the research that you have published SAP
